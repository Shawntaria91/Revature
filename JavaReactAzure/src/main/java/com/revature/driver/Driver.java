        why not autocommit?
        let's say we're inserting an artist followed by all their paintings
        to the DB -
        but for some reason our program / computer crashes halfway through inserting the
        paintings:
        it becomes difficult for us to know how information we're missing or has been lost
        this is a case where we need atomicity:
        either all transactions are completed, or all transactions fail
