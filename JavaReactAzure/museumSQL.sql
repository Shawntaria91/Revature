/*
Why do we use the cloud?
not spend so much on server resources
Microsoft Azure is among many cloud providers -
the real big player is AWS, but its market share is shrinking because of the growth in Azure and GCP
why cloud?
global availability - regional data centers
high availability - region pairing
scalability
	if we have high usage at one point, we can auto scale up or auto scale down
	which means our money is being used more efficiently
Infrastructure as a service
	purchasing a virtual machine
Platform as a service
	azure devops
		azure devops just runs some script that we feed it builds our project (maven) for us
	azure sql
Software as a service
	salesforce, servicenow, pega

SQL?
Structured Query Language
Relational Database
whats that?
Items in one table can be related to items in another
There are many flavors of SQL - because native SQL is pretty simplistic,
many versions have been created to add new features (mysql, postgres, azuresql)
NoSQL
MongoDB, Cosmos, Cassandra
datatypes:
numeric:
int
bigint
float
money
strings:
char
varchar
binary:
bit
blob
clob
file
others:
date
datetime
in dbeaver, running single line at cursor: ctrl enter
running whole script: alt x
issues with non-relational organization
	1. redundancy
	2. what if a value needs to change?

constraints
primary key:
	the primary key MUST be unique
	the primary key MUST exist (not null)
	primary keys are indexed by default

foreign keys:
	MUST refer to an existing primary key

What we did with reducing redundancy between tables while maintaining the
dependency between painting and artist tables will relate to a topic
which we will talk about later - normalization
multiplicity - we can say that x amount of a correspond to y amount of b
for example, an artist many have many paintings
(many to one)
many paintings can be exhibited (over a single paintings lifetime) at many museums
(many to many)
a single thing might map to another single thing
(one to one)
entity relational diagrams - not something we'll look into but thanks for bringing it up

/*normalization is all about maintaining dependencies while reducing redundancy
 * artist table that contains an array containing all of their paintings
 * 1st normal form: all columns must be 'atomic' (meaning that they contain
 * single values), and must contain a primary key
 * in order to achieve, 1nf, the artist table mentioned must split up into
 * multiple rows of the same table, such that all of the items in the paintings column
 * are a single row
 *
 * 		not normalized at all: remedios varo, [p1, p2, p3]'
 *		(why is this bad? what if we want to search by painting?)
 * 		solution:
 * 		1nf: remedios varo, p1
 * 			remedios varo, p2
 *
 * 2nf: cannot have columns that are dependent on only one part of the key (partial dependencies)
 * not in 2nf:
 * pkey(remedios varo, painting1), title
 * pkey(remedios varo, painting2), title
 * (why is this bad? these would be more efficiently spread across tables)
 * solution:
 * artist: remedios varo
 * painting: painting1, title1
 * painting: painting2, title2
 *
 * 3nf: no transitive dependencies
 * artist: remedios varo, salutationID, mrs
 * artist: leonara carrington, salutationID, ms
 * artist: pablo picass, salutationID, mr
 * artist: wassily kandinsky, salutationID, mr
 * (why is this bad? if we change a salutation, we need to change both ms and salutationID)
 *
 * artist: remedios varo, salutationID (1)
 * artist: leonara carrington, salutationID (1) (2-> if leonara gets married)
 *
 * salutationID: 1, mrs
 * salutationID: 2, ms
 *
 * the lesson: redundancy is BAD, we want to always be reducing redundancy,
 * and dependencies are GOOD
